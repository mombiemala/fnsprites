// "You heard it here first" — confirmed-and-dated things that are COMING but not
// live yet. This is the early heads-up feed: it powers the Heads Up spotlight and
// a "Coming <date>" badge on any Sprite it names in the checklist.
//
// Rules (keep the feed trustworthy):
//  - Only add items that are CONFIRMED with a source + a date. Pure rumors stay
//    in News/roster as "Rumored" — they do NOT belong here.
//  - `confirmedDate:false` marks a solid item whose *exact date* is still an
//    estimate (shown as "~"). The item itself is still confirmed-coming.
//  - `typeIds` / `spriteIds` (optional) tie an item to Sprites in the roster so
//    they get a "Coming <date>" badge. Only UNRELEASED Sprites show the badge —
//    once a Sprite is released the badge naturally stops (and the item should be
//    removed here and the Sprite flipped released).
//
// The daily rotation watch and the Season 5 leak-watch keep this current.
